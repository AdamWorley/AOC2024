# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 – Ruby Edition! 🎅

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** project, where the holiday spirit meets the elegance of Ruby programming! 🌟 Whether you're here for the festive fun or curious to see how I tackle these coding challenges, you're in the right place. Let's sleigh this!

## 🎁 What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of programming puzzles that unlock one at a time from December 1st through December 25th. It's like an advent calendar, but instead of chocolates, we get brain-bending coding challenges! (Okay, I'd still take the chocolates too 🍫.)

## 🧑‍💻 About This Project

This repo is my collection of Ruby solutions for the **Advent of Code 2024** challenges. Each day brings a new puzzle, and I'll be solving them using the simplicity, readability, and downright joy of Ruby. 🛠️✨

### Why Ruby?

- Ruby makes the mundane magical. 🌟
- Writing elegant, human-readable code is half the fun!
- Plus, `puts "Merry Christmas!"` is just too wholesome. 🎅

## 🚀 How It Works

Each day's puzzle has its own file and corresponding tests. Here's how the project is organized:

```bash
.
├── day1/
│   ├── part1.rb        # Solution for day 1 - part 1 
│   ├── part2.rb        # Solution for day 1 - part 2
│   └── example.txt     # Example input for Day 1
├── day2/
│   ├── ...
└── README.md           # You're reading it right now!
```

### Running a Solution

Want to see some Ruby magic in action? Run a day's solution like this:

```bash
ruby day1/part1.rb
```

```bash
ruby day1/part2.rb
```

### Running the Tests

We don't need tests where we're going...
